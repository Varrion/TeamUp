                            Sportâ€™s main purposes are to promote physical activity and improve
                            motor skills for health and performance and psychosocial development.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Positive effects from sports are achieved primarily through physical activity, but
                            secondary effects bring health benefits such as psychosocial and personal development
                            and less alcohol consumption.
                        </p>
                        <p>  Human biology requires a certain amount of physical activity to maintain good health and wellbeing.</p>
                        <p>  Participants also gain a chance to be part of a community, develop new social circles, and create social norms and attitudes.</p>
                        <p> Taking part in sport can help us feel fitter, healthier and mentally strong, and that is just the start of it. Sport can also be fun,
                            especially when played as part of a team or with family or friends.<br /><br /></p>
